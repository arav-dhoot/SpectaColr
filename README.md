# Spectacolr
This is a website about an Android-based application, SpectaColr, which was co-created by my friend and me. SpectaColr is an application that aims to aid the color-blind. This website serves as a landing page for the app and is an information hub for the application.
 
 Edit: The app is no longer on the Google App Store.
